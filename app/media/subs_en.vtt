00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000 D: vertical A: start
Well this time we are going to talk about the trigonometric identities in this

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.000
Video specifically what we are going to do is build in quotation marks

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.500
Construct the most important formulas that will later be applied in all

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The examples that will be published to verify that an identity is or is not

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Is trigonometric identity but in this video I insist we are going to display the formulas

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.000
is

8
00: 00: 28,000 -> 00: 00: 29,000
good

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Is that we are going to exhibit 9 formulas in total that therefore seems a very very number

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Great but the idea is that we achieved a fairly simple and that all

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's learn to deduce. Let's see the first thing we are going to do is relate

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Trigonometric functions with something we already did in another video that is

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Recommended a lot of people who have not seen it is called reasons

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Trigonometric that is what we did in that video we placed around here 6 formulas

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
A 2 3 4 5 and 6 that was what we did in that video

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Remember that there we placed in that order the next sine of x then

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We put tangent in the third position and I tell them because and then we put

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The secant in the fifth position, turns out to be very good

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
To learn that order sine tanjente secante because it turns out that the other three

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Start up co

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If this is sine of x the next will be cosine of x is simply put

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There if it is tanjente of x the next will be cotanjente of x and if this secante by

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Of course the other will be cosecante of x soon a good way to remember the

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Acronym is like csc is the cosecante form camila was silent this

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Emerged as with a student in a class in the commentary or how

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There is always explained it this way and people like it and well you learn it

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Pretty easy camila fell ready let's see how we relate now

28
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
These trigonometric functions well making use of the video in the reasons

29
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Trigonometric we explained that the former was contrary to the last

30
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Then we touch him by arca link these two the second with the fifth and third

31
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
With the fourth

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What does it mean to be specifically against the following if

33
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Sine of x is the opposite that cosecante of x cosecante of x is the same

34
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That cosecante of x on one the opposite will be to change the order that

35
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Would give 1 on cosecant of x that is to say that we would remain as one on cosecante

36
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Of x and of the sine the opposite of cosecante ones on cosecante and by

37
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Supposed cosecante to be the opposite of the breast we would have 1 envelopes the breast

38
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Of x we ​​do exactly the same with the cosine cosine function is the

39
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Inverse multiplicative of the secant which would give us one on secant of

40
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
X and secante the same opposite with the second that is cosine and us

41
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
One would remain on cosine of x with the tangent we do exactly

42
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Same with the cotangent and we would be 1 on cotangente and cotangente

43
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Of course with the third that is tangal would be one on tangent of x but

44
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It turns out that the tangent and cotangent function when we apply them

45
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Formulas we are building here in quotation marks

46
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And the practical exercises already to verify that something is an entity the

47
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Tangent remembering the video of the trigonometric reasons we said there

48
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Which is sine on cosine ie the tangents creating it precisely

49
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
As well as sine of x on cosine of x this is to say that it is not that we are harmed but

50
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That the same would apply the same as the cotangent is the opposite of the

51
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Tangent the inverse multiplicative as it would change the order here is to say

52
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
That the cotangent is written as a cosine on breasts and these would be the

53
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Six very important first formulas that will be used in all

54
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Later examples and in this video is concretely we will explain 9 did

55
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So we know it very well and we are going to apply it easily in the

56
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Exercises in ternas that area of ​​xenopus denote people votes people of

57
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Kant songs this is it here we are going to take into account the

58
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
That they are to those of here pieces of a camps those of acam as they are not like

59
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So keys for now ready to show where the other three come out the 7 8 and 9

60
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The formula is if I would really like to be caught from memory that is

61
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
A very important entity a formula well well key and is that square sine

62
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Plus square cosine equals 1

63
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We place precisely that square sine of x plus square cosine

64
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
From x equal to 1 to this formula is so important that it even has an identity name

65
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Pythagorean every time they are told of the Pythagorean identity refers to this

66
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Square sine of a more cosine square angle of the same angle equals 1 this ideentity in

67
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Reality comes out of a right triangle using the

68
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Pythagoras suddenly later we deepen it so that much remains

69
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Clearer but let's say that for now we learn this from memory and

70
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We are going to deduce the eighth and the ninth to deduce the eighth what we are going to do

71
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Is the following where to place exactly what the identity says there

72
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Pitagorica square sine plus square cosine equal to 1 and what we are going to

73
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
To do is to divide all the terms between the square sine of x then sine

74
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
X square here and here too and here too obviously this good

75
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That this equality is still preserved, which we are dividing between the same

76
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Amount to each of the terms

77
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Then what we do is simply apply the formulas we already saw in

78
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The first part the six first formulas that we have here then

79
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We told you the good square sine on square sine if we

80
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Cancels every number divided by itself gives one since it is not zero over zero

81
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Sine square sibre sine square would give us a cosine on sine

82
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Let us notice that according to the first six formulas we have

83
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Here cosine on breast is exactly equal to the cotangent but as in this

84
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
If they are to square of serious cosine to the square sine to the square would be cotángente

85
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
To the square of x then we simply place it there cotangent to the square of x

86
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And that is equal to 1 on sine to the square fijem that one on sine of

87
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
According to this board 1 on sine is the sixth that would be cosecante of x like one

88
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
On sine is cosecante of x we ​​place it as is but

89
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Let's note that this is as if it were 1 squared on sine to square

90
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
One squared is equal to one or is it actually would be like one on

91
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Sine all squared then would give cosecant to the square of x and this would be our octave

92
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Formula that we have just deduced is not actually much easier to learn

93
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
To deduce it using the Pythagorean identity and dividing everything between square sine of x what

94
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Happens is that in fact this sometimes is as complicated one to learn not sometimes to one

95
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
He forgets that one more cotangent to the square of x is equal to cosecante to the square of

96
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
X when that happens we simply take the Pythagorean identity and divide everything between sine

97
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Square of x of equal way and already so that we finish the video the ninth formula

98
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It would simply be to retake the Pythagorean identity as it is

99
0:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Ahi sneo square plus square cosine equal to one and what we do now is not to divide

100
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Between square sine but between square cosine then we put cosine

101
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Square here and here and ready and apply all the formulas

102
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Which we saw earlier in exactly the same way

103
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Then we take into account that sine on cosano in a tablita to the third

104
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Sine on cosine is tangent but we already know that as is the square

105
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Would be squared the tangent

106
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So these two are the square then would be tangent to the square of x mas

107
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
That we do exactly the same cosine about cosine are squared but

108
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Are the same cancel and give us one and finally one on cosine

109
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
That we already know that all this is like one on cosine all squared in one

110
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Tablita a cosine is secante of ex and place it to the square and of this one

111
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Way we deduce the last of the new formulas we have just looked at but

112
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Then very importantly advised them I give that advice that then we

113
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Let's learn in that way sine tangent secant and then co co and co so that

114
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Is much faster and that one is the inverse multiplicative of the other

115
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The first with the sixth second with the fifth and third with the fourth and these

116
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Three using the Pythagorean identity simply by dividing between square sine and

117
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Between square x cosine good with it we already have our 9 formulas

118
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Main that now we are going to be able to use in the other videos to know

119
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
When something is or is not a trigonometric identity I hope you have liked it

120
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Much this video that have cleared doubts that can share it with their friends and

121
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
We can continue to help many more people

122
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Many successes as always for everyone and we will continue to find each other

123
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Occasion, bye
